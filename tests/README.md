How to run tests? make script start app or assume it's running?
Add reports and retries?

SO MUCH TO DO BUT THIS IS A GOOD FRAMEWORK I CAN WORK WITH

Bugs

- The ReadMe needs updating, it says the username and password are both "pa55word" but the username is actually "user1" - Not sure if that was on purpose or a genuine mistake, I found the username in LoginForm.js

How To Run

- You can run linting and prettier
