# How To Run

## Through command line

1. Start the app by following the instructions in the README.md
2. From the tests folder run `npm install` to pull the dependencies
3. To run all the tests in electron `npm run allTests`
4. To run the login tests in electron `npm run loginTests`
5. To run the news tests in electron `npm run newsTests`

## Through Cypress test runner

1. Start the app by following the instructions in the README.md
2. From the tests folder run `npm install` to pull the dependencies
3. To run all the tests in electron `npm run cypress:open`
4. From the test runner pick the browser (see notes for why you should pick electron)
5. Click on the feature file you wish to run to start the tests

## Linting and prettier checks

I included scripts to run eslint and prettier on the test code. The following scripts can be run to do the checks:

- eslint check: `npm run eslint:check`
- prettier check: `npm run prettier:check`
- prettier fix: `npm run prettier:fix`
- eslint and pretier check: `npm run beforeMerge`

# Notes

- I used different selector types on purpose just to show my understanding of finding elements based on class, ID, name etc

- The code to disable the internet connection contains a bug in Chrome, see this stackoverflow thread and the related open Cypress bug ticket https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70742901/moving-to-offline-mode-using-cypress-returned-a-promise-that-never-resolved the work around is to run in electron which is why I force that browser in the scripts.

- Two sceanrios that I was asked to write failed because of bugs in the code, I still wrote the tests for them assuming the outcome when fixed.

- I added Cypress retries so if a test fails due to a slow network connection etc. it will retry the test one more time.

# Possible improvements

- Create a ticket to include data attributes in the app to make finding elements easier, the react class names can be very long and not easily readable.

- Add junit reports - can be useful to export the artefacts in CI

**Bug description**
We have a security issue, we are informing potential hackers when they have guessed a valid username. If you enter an invalid user name we display the message "Wrong username", if you enter a valid user name and invalid password we display "Password incorrect"

If a hacker tried a brute force attack with common user names like admin or root we would essentially be telling them when they have guess correctly and they can move onto the password field.

**Steps to reproduce**
From the login form enter an invalid username

**Expected behaviour**
We should never tell a user which part of the username or password is incorrect, instead we should say there was a problem and they should check their username and password

**Actual behaviour**
We tell the user when the username is incorrect.

**Bug description**
Scenario "User opens web site next time (when previously logged in)" does not work as expected, refreshing the news page or going back to the home page displays the login form instead of keeping us signed in.

**Steps to reproduce**
Login to the app
When you are taken to the news page reload the page

Login to the app
From the news page revisit the home page

**Expected behaviour**
Refreshing the page or revisintg the login form after we have signed in should take us back to the news page and keep us logged in.

**Actual behaviour**
We aren't setting a cookie or anything in sesion storage to keep us logged in so once we reload the page or revisit the home page we need to login again.

set the password to pa55wordThisPartIsWrong

It doesn't matter what the username or password is set to, if the string contains the valid credentials you will be logged in.
